## v2.9.0 2014 February 26
- Now supports multiple partial paths
	- Thanks to [pflannery](https://github.com/pflannery) for [pull request #14](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-partials/pull/14)

## v2.8.1 2013 November 6
- Fixed error reporting when a partial breaks (regression since always???)
- Partials now render inside the `renderDocument` event, rather than any random time
- Updated dependencies

## v2.8.0 2013 August 23
- Template data is now sent with partial calls by default, and can be turned off by setting the first object you pass the the partial as `false`, e.g. `<%- @partial('hello', false, blah) %>`
	- This has been documented quite thoroughly now in the README
	- This backwards compatibility break is due to the incredibly high amount of "user error" issues not sending the template data by default causes. In hindsight, it has become apparent to us that sacrificing docpad performance time for developer performance time and developer happiness is a far better trade. Caring about performance should come secondary to happiness. Not before it.
	- For those whom do care about performance, you should update all your existing partial calls to make use of the new first `false` object practice, or if you are too lazy set `performanceFirst: true` in the plugin's configuration options.

## v2.2.1 2012 November 6
- Fixed memory leak (didn't clean up after generations, so regenerations would take longer and longer)
	- Fixes [#335](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/335)

## v2.2.0 2012 October 7
- `@partial` signature now changed from `@partial(name,data)` to `@partial(name,objs...)`
	- If multiple objects are specified, they will be shallow-y merged into an empty object
	- This allows you to do things like `@partial('blah',@,{blah:'blah'})` to extend the partial `blah` with the template data and some custom partial data
