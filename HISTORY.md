# History

## v2.9.2 March 5, 2015
- Updated dependencies

## v2.9.1 May 7, 2014
- Minor improvements to make debugging easier

## v2.9.0 February 26, 2014
- Now supports multiple partial paths
	- Thanks to [pflannery](https://github.com/pflannery) for [pull request #14](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-partials/pull/14)

## v2.8.1 November 6, 2013
- Fixed error reporting when a partial breaks (regression since always???)
- Partials now render inside the `renderDocument` event, rather than any random time
- Updated dependencies

## v2.8.0 August 23, 2013
- Template data is now sent with partial calls by default, and can be turned off by setting the first object you pass the the partial as `false`, e.g. `<%- @partial('hello', false, blah) %>`
	- This has been documented quite thoroughly now in the README
	- This backwards compatibility break is due to the incredibly high amount of "user error" issues not sending the template data by default causes. In hindsight, it has become apparent to us that sacrificing docpad performance time for developer performance time and developer happiness is a far better trade. Caring about performance should come secondary to happiness. Not before it.
	- For those whom do care about performance, you should update all your existing partial calls to make use of the new first `false` object practice, or if you are too lazy set `performanceFirst: true` in the plugin's configuration options.

## v2.7.2 July 30, 2013
- You can now customise the collection name via the `collectioName` option

## v2.6.2 April 17, 2013
- Fixed cacheable partials (broke in v2.6.0)

## v2.6.1 April 6, 2013
- Fixed `???` being outputted for empty partials (bug introduced in v2.6.0)
	- Closes [issue #5](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-partials/issues/5) and [pull request #6](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-partials/pull/6) thanks to [Bob VanderClay](https://github.com/takitapart) and [Bruno HÃ©ridet](https://github.com/Delapouite)

## v2.6.0 April 6, 2013
- Partials now begin rendering as soon as we receive them
- Dependency upgrades

## v2.5.2 April 5, 2013
- Dependency upgrades

## v2.5.1 April 1, 2013
- Dependency upgrades

	-  `coffee-script` from 1.4.x to ~1.4.0

## v2.4.0 December 15, 2012
- Removed the possibility of name collisions when storing partial info
- You can now cache a partial by setting `cacheable: true` in the partial's meta data
	- Doing this will only render it once per (re)generation. Cache is cleared after each (re)generation.

## v2.3.0 November 23, 2012
- New way of doing partials
	- Should be faster
	- Should support watching better
	- Supports fuzzy matching

## v2.2.1 November 6, 2012
- Fixed memory leak (didn't clean up after generations, so regenerations would take longer and longer)
	- Fixes [#335](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/335)

## v2.2.0 October 7, 2012
- `@partial` signature now changed from `@partial(name,data)` to `@partial(name,objs...)`
	- If multiple objects are specified, they will be shallow-y merged into an empty object
	- This allows you to do things like `@partial('blah',@,{blah:'blah'})` to extend the partial `blah` with the template data and some custom partial data

## v2.1.2 August 10, 2012
